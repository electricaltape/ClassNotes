* 'Better than van driest' idea
  We know the element size in the 'bulk' and at the coast. We can easily scale
  correction effects based on element size with a multiplier that is 1 in the bulk
  and 0 at the edge. More specifically, given the edge length, compute a multiplier
  on the LES term that ranges from 0 to 1.
