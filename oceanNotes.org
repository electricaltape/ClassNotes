* Describing Vorticity and Stream Functions

** Vorticity

*** From lec16.pdf

    Starting point for large-scale circulation
    Similar to 2D incompressible flow (Navier-Stokes)
    main difference - Vorticity variable is 3D Laplacian of Stream Function


**** TODO Assumption - wind driven ocean flow. Check this.

** Stream Function

*** From ch13.pdf

    Psi is the stream function
    Say that geostrophic flow is parallel to constant lines Psi
    Strength proportional to 'spacing of iso-lines of Psi'

*** Equation

    Laplacian_p of Psi = dv_g/dx - du_g/dy ~ Zeta_rel

* Physical Constants

** Rossby Number

** f-plane

*** From ch13.pdf

    Coriolis parameter f - some trigonometric function of latitude (ch13)
    f-plane approximation - replace occurances of f with a constant f0

**** From ch13.pdf : Better Approximation - Beta-plane

     Allow f to vary in north-south direction linearly:

     f = f0 + beta * (y - y0)

     where beta = (df/ (a d phi) )_0 = 2 * Omega * cos phi_0 / a
     (so beta is the linearization constant for moving in direction y)

     typical choice - phi_0 = 45 degrees -> beta = 1.62e-11 m^-1 s^-1
