* Two Kingdoms
  *Spectral* : global expansion method.
  Interpolating and non-interpolating
** Interpolating/Pseudospectral
   + Associate grid with basis
   + Force agreement with truncated series and forcing function
   + For ODE/PDE: force residual to interpolate zero at points.
     + Sometimes called colocation or interpolation points
   + Interpolate at Gauss points? Like an integral method.
** Noninterpolating
   + Things like Galerkin and Tau methods
