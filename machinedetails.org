** Overview of Double Precision (Wikipedia)
   + 1 sign bit
   + 11 exponent bits
   + 53 significand bits (52 explicit)
** How does the significand work?
   If the exponent is all zeros then the implied digit is a zero (this is when
   we have zero the additive identity element). Otherwise this digit is assumed
   to be one.
** How does the exponent work?
   the exponent is a multiplicative offset

       2^(e - 1023)

   note that (- (expt 2 11) 1) => 2047, so this offset lets the exponent range from
   -1023 to 1024.
** Fun Facts about spacing
*** Where does double precision only store integers?
    between 2^52 and 2^53 no decimal parts are possible. Between 2^53 and 2^54
    we can only store even integers.
