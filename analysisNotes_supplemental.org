* Continuity

** Mappings and Inverses (4.8)

   A mapping f :: X -> Y is continuous on X iff f^-1(V) is open in X for every
   open set V in Y.

*** Immediate Corollary

    A mapping f :: X -> Y is continuous iff f^-1(C) is closed in X for every
    closed set C in Y.

** Vector valued functions

   f(x) := (f1(x), f2(x), ... , fn(x))

   f is continuous iff each f1, f2, ... , fn is continuous.

* Compactness

** Boundedness

   say that f :: E -> RR^k is bounded if abs(f(x)) .LEQ. M forall x in E.

   (the book uses the 2-norm)
