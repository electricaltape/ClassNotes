* Getting boost_mpi working on a macintosh
  Compile via

      mpic++ -L/Users/drwells/Local/lib -I/Users/drwells/Local/include \
      mpiboost2.cpp -o mpiboost2.out -lboost_mpi

  where mpic++ links to the usual mpi library (and possibly mpi headers).

  Make sure that the environment variable DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to include the
  boost libraries. Then execute as

      mpirun -np 4 -x DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH ./a.out

  or whatnot.
