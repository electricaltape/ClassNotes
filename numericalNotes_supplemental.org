* Goal Statement
  Some parts of the class notes and the book do not mesh well, or are not
  sufficiently well organized. I want to ameliorate this by starting a combined
  note repository with bits of both integrated in.

** Convergence of Iterative Methods
   From wikipedia - spectral radius of the iteration matrix less than one.
   Let B be some iteration matrix, and let A be the original matrix.
   Tentative assumption 1: if rho(B) < 1 then the iterative method converges.
   Tentative assumption 2: A strictly/irreducibly diagonally dominant then the
                           iterative method converges.
   Tentative assumption 3: A strictly/irreducibly diagonally dominant then the
*** Jacobi Method
    in particular, J = D^-1 (L + U)
*** Gauss-Seidel Method
    in particular, GS = (L + D)^-1 U
    if A is SPD then the Gauss-Seidel method converges.

** Properties of SPD matricies
   Again, from wikipedia - has positive determinant
   All eigenvalues are positive.
