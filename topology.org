* Topological Space
** Definitions (Axioms)
   Let X be a set. Let T be a collection of subsets. (X,T) is a _topological space_
   if

   1. The empty set and X are in T
   2. T is closed under arbitrary unions
   3. T is closed under finite intersection

   Similarly, T is called a _topology_ on X.
