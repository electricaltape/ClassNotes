**** DONE Mean value theorem for integrals
     CLOSED: [2013-08-15 Thu 10:12]
     _From Wikipedia_: If G is continuous and phi is integrable (and does not
     change sign on the interval), then there exists some x in the interval such
     that

         INTEGRAL G(t) phi(t) dx = G(x) INTEGRAL phi(t) dt.
**** DONE Absolute Continuity
     CLOSED: [2013-08-15 Thu 10:14]
     f is *absolutely continuous* on some interval if for all eps, there exists
     a delta such that (for pairwise disjoint intervals (x_k, y_k) comprising
     the domain of integration)

         SUM abs(x_k, y_k) < delta -> SUM abs(f(x_k) - f(y_k)) < eps.
**** DONE Basic Lp proofs
     CLOSED: [2013-08-16 Fri 12:47]
     Holder, Minkowski, Cauchy, and Cauchy-Schwarz variants for Lp and related
     inner product spaces.

     *Holder*: start with ab <= a^p/p + b^q/q (Young's inequality). Normalize f
     and g by the p and q norms and integrate, yielding

         norm(f g, 1) <= 1 = norm(f, p) norm(g, q)

     *Minkowski*: Just the triangle inequality.

     *Cauchy*: Start with 0 <= (a - b)^2 -> a b <= a^2/2 + b^2/2. Reassign
     variables as a := sqrt(2 eps) a and b := 1/sqrt(2 eps) b.

     *Cauchy-Schwarz*: Also skip this proof.
**** DONE The Triplets
     CLOSED: [2013-08-16 Fri 12:51]
     Dominated convergence, monotone convergence, Fatou. They are useful, but I
     probably will not need the proofs.

     *Dominated convergence*: Suppose abs(f_n(x)) <= g(x) and f_n -> f
     pointwise. Then

         limit(n, inf, INTEGRAL abs(f_n - f)) = 0.

     *Monotone convergence*: If {f_n} is a sequence of monotonically increasing
     functions, then

         limit(n, inf, INTEGRAL f_n dm) = INTEGRAL (limit, n, inf, f_n).

     *Fatou's Lemma*: Let {f_n} be a sequence of nonnegative measurable
     functions. Then

         INTEGRAL (lim inf f_n) <= lim inf INTEGRAL f_n

     where the first lim inf is computed pointwise.
** Semester 1
*** Sturm-Liouville Problems
    Corresponds to HW 6 from semester 1.

    From SL.pdf:
    1. Eigenvalues are real, countable, ordered; there is a smallest
       eigenvalue. There is no largest eigenvalue.
    2. For each eigenvalue lambda_n there is an eigenfunction phi_n with n - 1
       zeros on (a, b).
    3. The set of eigenfunctions is orthogonal (with respect to the norm weighted
       by sigma(x)) and complete.
*** l2 (sequence spaces)
    Corresponds to HW 2 from semester 1. Probably not very important.
** Semester 2
*** Characteristic surfaces
    *Single-variable case*: (grad phi)' A (grad phi) = 0, phi = 0, where A is the
    quadratic form of the equation.
*** Test functions
    The integral of the derivative of a test function must be zero.
*** 'The distributional sense'
    f_k -> f *distributionally* if for every test function phi
        INTEGRAL f_k phi -> INTEGRAL f phi
    or something like that.
*** Strictly Hyperbolic
    There are several definitions of this term. Evans says that a *semilinear
    system*

        U_t + B(U) U_x = 0

    is *strictly hyperbolic* if the eigenvalues of B(U) are real and distinct for
    all points in the domain.
*** Operators
    Symmetric operators have real eigenvalues.

    The adjoint of an operator L, L', satisfies (u, Lv) = (L' u, v) for all v in
    the domain of L and u in the domain of L'.
*** Maximum Principles
**** Elliptic
     Usually, 'weak' maximum principle refers to the existence of maximums and
     the 'strong' part refers to where they are (can there be multiple maximums
     on the interior and exterior?)
     1. Assume Delta u = 0 on the interior and u = f >= 0 on the
        boundary. If f is positive somewhere on the boundary, then u is strictly
        positive on the interior of the domain.
     2. If u is harmonic on the interior of a domain U, the maximum of u over U
        equals the maximum of u on the boundary of U.
     3. (Renardy & Rogers, weak maximum principle) If L u >= 0 in a bounded
        domain and c(x) = 0 on said domain, then the maximum of u is achieved on
        the boundary.
     4. (Renardy & Rogers, strong maximum principle) Assume that L u >= 0 in a
        bounded domain and u is not constant. If c = 0, then u does not achieve
        its maximum in the interior of the domain. If c <= 0, then u cannot
        achieve a non-negative maximum in the interior. Regardless of the sign of
        c, u canot be zero at an interior maximum.

     *Assisting lemma*: Suppose Omega is on one side of dOmega. Assume L u >= 0
     and x0 in dOmega, u(x0) > u(x) for all x in the interior. Assume dOmega is
     sufficiently smooth. Then if either c = 0, c <= 0 and u(x0) >= 0, or u(x0)
     = 0, then du(x0)/dn > 0 (unit outward normal).
**** Parabolic
*** The 'Weights Game'
    Useful for determining the type of a system of PDEs. The rules are:
    1. Every equation gets a weight 's_i'.
    2. Every variable gets a weight 't_j'.
    3. The order of each entry L_ij must *not* exceed s_i + t_j.
    4. The principle part now consists of the determinant of the system, only
       using entries where s_i + t_j = order of L_ij.
*** Characteristics and First-Order PDEs
    Evans proves that characteristics take on the form

        y(s) = (F'(g(x0)) s + x0, s)

    for first-order PDEs (in particular for conservation law equations).

    To solve linear and quasilinear problems, consider

        p(s) = D u(x(s))
        z(s) = u(x(s))

     (that is, the derivative along the path and the path itself). Then, after
     some manipulations

         dz/ds = D_p F( ... ) dot p(s)
         dx/ds = D_p(F( ... ))

     where F(Du, u, x) = 0 is quasilinear. D_p refers to differentiating F by
     the values of p (that is, u_x, u_y, u_t, etc).

* Things to memorize
** TODO Fourier Transform (Evans' version)
   Know the definition, convolution, a few basic transforms.
** TODO Formulae for nonlinear, 1st order PDE
** TODO Gronwall's Inequality
*** Statement
    If u'(t) <= b(t) u(t), then u(t) <= u(a) exp(INTEGRAL (a, t) b(s) ds)
*** Proof
    v(t) := exp(INTEGRAL (a, t) b(s) ds). Note that v'(t) = b(t) v(t). After
    applying the quotient rule

        d/dt u(t)/v(t) = 0

    so u(t)/v(t) <= u(a)/v(a) (MVT) so u(t)/v(t) <= u(a), which is the desired
    result.
*** Recipe
    1. Define the auxillary function v(t) := exp(INTEGRAL (a, t) b(s) ds).
    2. Show that d/dt u(t)/v(t) <= 0, so u(a)/v(a) >= u(t)/v(t).
    3. v(a) = 1, so we are done.
** TODO Proof for Garding
*** Statement
    I will assume a second-order PDE (the general proof is much harder). Let
    Omega be a bounded domain and L(x, D) be a second-order linear operator in
    divergence form. Assume that all the coefficients are in L-infinity. Then
    there exist constants c3 and lambdaG >= 0 such that

    B(u, u) + lambdaG norm(u, L2)^2 >= c3 norm(u, H1)^2

    where B = - SUM (i, j from 1 to n) INTEGRAL_Omega a_ij u_xj v_xi dx
    + SUM (i from 1 to n) INTEGRAL b_i u_xi v dx
           + INTEGRAL c(x) u v dx /* usual inner product */
*** Proof
    Applying Holder's inequality and the uniform ellipticity condition we
    obtain

    B(u, u) >= theta INTEGRAL (grad u)^2 dx
    - max norm(b_i, L-infinity) INTEGRAL abs(grad u) abs(u) dx
                - norm(c, L-infinity) INTEGRAL abs(u)^2 dx.

    Then, using the identity

        - a b >= -eps a^2 - 1/(4 eps) b^2

    with a = abs(grad u) and b = max(norm(b_i, L-infinity), i) abs(u) and
    integrating we end up with an L2 norm of grad u and and L2 norm of
    u. Applying Poincare-Fredrichs gets the desired H1 norm of u.
