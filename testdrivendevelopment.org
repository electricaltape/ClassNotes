** Overview
   Test driven development has its own flow. Learn about mocking up internals,
   mocking objects, etc. Study this.
** Specific advice
   + Try to keep the whole team using TDD. Partial use is terrible.
   + Write a sufficient (perhaps not 100% coverage) test suite.
   + Use a tool to determine coverage automatically.
   + Tests should execute quickly.
   + Do not ignore failing tests!
   + Make sure that the test code is clean as well as the project code.
   + Tests should be orthogonal (each has exactly one reason to fail)
